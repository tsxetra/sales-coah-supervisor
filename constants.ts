Salesperson: Hi, this is Alex from Innovate Solutions. Am I speaking with Jamie?
Prospect: Yes, this is Jamie.
Salesperson: Great, thanks for taking my call. I'm reaching out because I saw your company recently expanded its operations, and I thought our project management software could help streamline your new workflows. It's designed to handle complexity and scale. We've helped companies like yours reduce project overhead by up to 20%. Do you have a few minutes to discuss how we might be able to do the same for you?
Prospect: I'm a bit busy right now. We are using something already.
Salesperson: I understand completely. Many of our best customers were also using another tool when we first spoke. What they found was that our platform's real-time collaboration features and automated reporting saved them hours each week. Could I perhaps send you a brief one-page case study to look over at your convenience?
Prospect: A case study? I guess that would be okay.
Salesperson: Perfect. What's the best email for you?
Prospect: It's jamie@examplecorp.com.
Salesperson: Got it. I'll send that over right away. I'll also include a link to my calendar. If you like what you see, feel free to book a 15-minute slot that works for you. Thanks for your time, Jamie.
Prospect: Okay, thank you. Bye.
